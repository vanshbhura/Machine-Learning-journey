# Machine Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **day-wise journey of learning Machine Learning from scratch**.

No magic libraries first.
No blind copy-paste.
Just fundamentals, math intuition, and clean implementations.

---

## 📌 Goal

* Understand **how ML actually works**
* Implement core algorithms **from scratch using NumPy**
* Build intuition before using sklearn
* Avoid tutorial hell

---

## 🧠 Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations

* Statistics intuition (mean, variance, distributions)
* Correlation vs causation
* NumPy essentials for ML

### Phase 2: Linear Regression (From Scratch)

* Cost functions
* Gradient descent
* Training & prediction without sklearn

### Phase 3: Multiple Features & Evaluation

* Feature scaling
* Overfitting vs underfitting
* Bias-variance tradeoff

### Phase 4: Classification

* Logistic regression from scratch
* Sigmoid, decision boundaries
* Classification metrics

### Phase 5: Real ML Workflow

* Train-test split
* Data preprocessing
* sklearn comparison
* End-to-end ML project

### Phase 6: Reflection

* Debugging ML models
* Common mistakes
* Ethics & limitations
* Final roadmap

## 🛠 Tech Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn (later phases)

## 📈 Progress
- Day 1: Statistics foundations using NumPy
- Day 2: Data distributions and outliers


This repo is updated **daily** as part of a disciplined ML learning routine.
